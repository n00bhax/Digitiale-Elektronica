TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock VGA_RGB_map/VGATiming_map/clock/inst/Clk100MHz is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks PixelClk_ClockingWizard and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock VGA_RGB_map/VGATiming_map/clock/inst/Clk100MHz is created on an inappropriate internal pin VGA_RGB_map/VGATiming_map/clock/inst/Clk100MHz. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
