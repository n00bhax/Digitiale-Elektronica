Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock VGA_RGB_map/VGATiming_map/clock/inst/Clk100MHz is created on an inappropriate internal pin VGA_RGB_map/VGATiming_map/clock/inst/Clk100MHz. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

There is a large setup violation of -6.302 ns between Triangles_map/s_FirstFrameReady_reg/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and VGA_RGB_map/s_addrb0_reg[8]/R (clocked by PixelClk_ClockingWizard). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
